get x min/max and y min/max

ask for input starting with "y=" (must include character x)

initialize a turtle under the name "grapher"

draw x and y lines

for every x value in the graph
    take the equation and replace the x with the current x value
    evaluate the equation with eval()
    have the grapher go to the current x value at the resulting y value
